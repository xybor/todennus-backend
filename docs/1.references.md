## Snowflake

Todennus utilizes Twitter's snowflake format for uniquely identifiable
descriptors (IDs).

Because Snowflake IDs are up to 64 bits in size (e.g. a uint64), they are always
returned as strings in the HTTP API to prevent integer overflows in some
languages.


## Authentication

For all authentication types, authentication is performed with the Authorization
HTTP header in the format.

For example:

```
GET /users/@me
Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}
```

## @me

`@me` can be used to replace `{user_id}` in all API requests to represent the
`{user_id}` of the authorized user.

## Scope
